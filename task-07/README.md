ATTEMPT-1
I tried to scrap the data from forbes and i could get the data on a csvfile as well as i couldnt print it. I tried the same on bloomberg page which is a similar website and it worked fine. Ive attached the program script and the csv file in test directory. Also ive attached the script to scrap from forbes here. I didnt include any csv file since its empty.

ATTEMPT-2
I tried goquery also, and i failed in scraping data from forbes. Ig i kinda gave up. Ig i tried my level best. I could have studied more about goquery, i will try to get back to this task at the end.
I tried goquery on other websites. It worked fine. I will attach my code, but its not the proper one to scrap the data to a csv, i just wanted to see whether its working with forbes elements.I will attach both the file try1 and try2.

#### please Kindly go through test directory in which i tried to scrap from bloomberg, which is a similar website like forbes using colly.
