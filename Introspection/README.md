# INTROSPECTION

## Why must we choose you?

As being a socially anxious and quiet person, joining this club will help me boost my social skills and make me able to express confidently.
I eventually became passionate about coding during the last 2 years. The satisfaction it brings when my code works after few attempts always kept boosting my dopamine. 
I started going through youtube and google searching for a perfect roadmap to complete my 4 years of batchelor which eventually landed my 
interests in google competitions and open source contribution. Unlucky for me jee went in vain. I knew about foss as soon i started going through quora about Amritha and since then i wanted to join this club and wanted to get a proper mentoring. Im not the best in this field but i can asure i will try my level best to learn and help.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I want to learn and get comfortable in dsa in my first semster. I know python -datatypes, datastructures-stack,queue , connecting sql , dealing with files -since i had python in my class 11 and 12. Instead of boosting my python skills i started learning c++ for dsa and hope i will complete c++ in next two months. I attempted many questions which helped me understand the concepts more. I want to learn java in future and android development later. Since i took ai, i will be indulged in many projects using python and hope that along with the help of the club will make it possible for me to think deep into real life issues and make projects on my own. I want to know more about open source contributions and coding competitions in next semsters and work on it.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would love to help others who is new to the club and leave a footprint even after i gratuate from Amritha.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The Selection process was good, not very hard, helped me go through the basics of programming and understand diffrent elements.
