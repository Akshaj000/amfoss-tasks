I couldnt do much on ram and gifts question. The question is confusing. The fairy told something on which ram who is very good at maths created an equation. Ram cant be wrong as well as fairy cant be wrong. Its beyond my understanding skill.I tried all the possible way i understood the question.

I tried fights on question using the list method in which it did not pass most of the test case. So i came to an undertanding that it has to be done using a diffrent method in which array is not traversed. Its the last day to submit and im still  trying. I have pasted the method in which traversing of list is there. I couldnt get to a decision on the method im working on. So i havent coded it yet. Im still trying to figure out an algorithm. I was able to get the correct output for single indexed bloodmarks using the the 2(v*k)+1 and half the length of n.
