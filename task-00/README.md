## Installing ubuntu

Installing ubuntu was pretty easy , ive dual booted ubuntu alonside windows after partitioning
my ssd and creating a free space.

I downloaded ubuntu from their website . Using rufus , flashed it in my pendrive.
Just restarted with usb plugged in . pressed f12 ,selected usb. Installed ubuntu in the free space i partitioned.

Also i use wsl on my windows since its a bit time taking to switch between os. 

I stopped using windows eventually since ubuntu felt easier for my tasks. Ive done few tasks maybe one or two osn windows.

okay i have typed more [here](http://akshaj000.github.io/2021/09/25/hello-world/).
