## Installing ubuntu
Installing ubuntu was pretty , ive dual booted ubuntu alonside windows after partitioning my ssd and creating a free space.

I downloaded ubuntu from their website . Using rufus , flashed it my pendrive.
Just restarted with usb plugged in . pressed f12 selected usb. Installed ubuntu in the free space i partitioned.

Also i use wsl on my windows since its a bit time taking to switch between os.
